## Phase 4 - Gallery Root Navigation

Summary:
- Added a dedicated "Output" chip in the Gallery directory row to jump back to the output root directory.
- Disabled the root control when already at the root path.
- Prevented the directory chip row from wrapping so the Output chip stays in place.

Files touched:
- `js/src/features/gallery/components/GalleryNav.jsx`
- `js/src/styles/ui-kit.css`
