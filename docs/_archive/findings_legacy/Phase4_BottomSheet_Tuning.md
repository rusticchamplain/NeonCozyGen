## Phase 4 - BottomSheet Shape + Dynamic Height Tuning

Summary:
- Switched sheet sizing to auto height with max-height caps so sheets expand to content before scrolling.
- Introduced sheet radius and max-height CSS variables and tuned mobile radius.
- Converted the sheet panel to a grid layout to keep header/body/footer stable while allowing body scrolling.

Files touched:
- `js/src/styles/overlays.css`
