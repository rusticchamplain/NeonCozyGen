## Phase 4 - Prompt Composer Alias Readability

Summary:
- Switched alias names to a two-line clamp instead of single-line ellipsis.
- Expanded alias description text to a four-line clamp for better visibility.
- Allowed prompt composer element labels (alias/tag tokens) to wrap to two lines instead of truncating.

Files touched:
- `js/src/styles/composer.css`
